# ML-IDS-Analyzer (Private Planning)

A machine learning-based alert validation system that classifies IDS alerts (e.g., from Suricata) as likely valid (true positive) or invalid (false positive). Designed and developed by final-year cybersecurity students, this project showcases applied ML in network defense by reducing alert noise and surfacing actionable threats.

---

## 🧠 Project Purpose

- Predict the likelihood that an IDS alert is valid using supervised ML.
- Minimize false positives in student SOC environments and small-scale deployments.
- Demonstrate practical application of cybersecurity data analysis and ML/AI modeling.
- Build a professional-grade portfolio project with real-world impact.

## ✅ Comprehensive To-Do List

### 🔹 Phase 1: Setup & Data
- [x] Create GitHub repo and structure
- [x] Initialize Git LFS and attempt push
- [x] Move CICIDS2017 CSVs into `data/cicids2017/`

### 🔹 Phase 2: Preprocessing
- [ ] Write `preprocess.py` to:
  - Merge CSVs
  - Clean columns
  - Handle missing values
  - Label encode target
  - Save merged dataset
- [ ] Engineer useful features from:
  - IPs, ports, protocols
  - Byte/packet statistics
  - Frequency/entropy heuristics

### 🔹 Phase 3: EDA & Baseline Modeling
- [ ] Load dataset in notebook
- [ ] Plot class imbalance and distributions
- [ ] Train baseline models (logistic regression, decision tree)
- [ ] Evaluate with ROC-AUC, F1, confusion matrix
- [ ] Write `model.py` to automate training

### 🔹 Phase 4: Evaluation
- [ ] Write `evaluate.py` for consistent metrics
- [ ] Add model explainability (feature importance)
- [ ] Store output: CSV with predictions + confidence

### 🔹 Phase 5: Presentation & Documentation
- [ ] Create demo notebook (end-to-end pipeline)
- [ ] Prepare internal slide deck
- [ ] Clean `README.md` for public view
- [ ] (Optional) Record project walkthrough video

## 💡 Notes & Ideas

- Incorporate time-based alert patterns (burst rate, session grouping)
- Explore feature selection techniques (correlation matrix, recursive elimination)
- Consider using entropy of destination ports or payload sizes
- Keep output human-readable (valid/invalid + % confidence)
- Optional extension: integrate with Suricata live output + web dashboard
- Stretch goal: publish results in a student cybersecurity research forum
